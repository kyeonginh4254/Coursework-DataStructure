# HW#4: Leaf-Leaning Red-Black Tree

* **Due data: 11:59pm, 11/10/2024**
* TA: Sangyun Kim (sangyun.kim@snu.ac.kr)

## Goals

* Get to implement an extreme data structure that is used widely today.

* Implement insert and delete function that inserts and deletes an item
  to/from a red-black tree without affecting the invariants of the tree
  (e.g., black balance, no back-to-back red, etc.)

## Left-Leaning Red-Black Tree

### Background

Red-black trees are famous variants of a balanced search tree. It is used
by the Linux kernel, standard library of various programming languages, etc.
However, the original algorithm of red-black tree was *very* complex.
In 2008, Robert Sedgewick invented a simple implementation of the red-black
tree that works pretty fine and whose implementation is way shorter than
the known ones.

### Properties

Red-black trees have to satisfy the following properties:

0. There are red nodes and black nodes.
1. The number of black nodes along with all paths to the leaves are the same.
2. No two red nodes appears back-to-back, which ensures the length of
   the longest path is 2x times longer at maximum than the shortest path.
3. The root node is black

Left-leaning red-black tree adds an extra constraint that simplifies the
implementation:

4. If only one child of a black node is red, it must be the left one.

## Types

We will take a look at the types. Do you remember `std::optional<T>` and
`std::unique_ptr<T>`?:

```c++
template<typename T>
struct RBTree {
    std::unique_ptr<RBNode<T>> root = nullptr;

    ~RBTree() = default;

    bool insert(const T&);
    void remove_max();
    void remove_min();
    void remove(const T&);

    const std::optional<T> leftmost_key();
    const std::optional<T> rightmost_key();

    bool contains(const T& t);
};

template<typename T>
struct RBNode {
    T key;
    color_t color = RED;
    std::unique_ptr<RBNode> left = nullptr;
    std::unique_ptr<RBNode> right = nullptr;

    RBNode(const T& t);
    ~RBNode() = default;

    bool is_leaf();

    void flip_color();
    static RBNode* rotate_right(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);
    static RBNode* rotate_left(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);
    static bool is_red(const std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);

    static RBNode* move_red_right(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);
    static RBNode* move_red_left(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);

    static RBNode* remove_max(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);
    static RBNode* remove_min(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);
    static RBNode* remove(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&, const T&);

    static RBNode* insert(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&, const T&);

    static RBNode* fix_up(std::unique_ptr<RBNode>&);

    bool contains(const T& t);

    const T& leftmost_key();
    const T& rightmost_key();
};
```

Your goal is to fill in all of the `TODO` regions. Please refer to [1] and
[this note][./rbtree.pdf] for detailed explanations.

## Implementing LLRB insertion and deletion

For insertion, you should fill in

* `RBNode::rotate_right`
* `RBNode::rotate_left`
* `RBNode::flip_color`
* `RBNode::insert`

These are functions that are required to implement deletion:

* `RBNode::fix_up`
* `RBNode::remove`
* `RBNode::remove_max`
* `RBNode::remove_min`
* `RBNode::move_red_right`
* `RBNode::move_red_left`

## Submission and Grading

### Tips

* Use `get()` and `release()` methods to extract raw pointers from `unique_ptr`;
* There is a typo in pseudo code of the original slide of left-leaning red-black
tree; and
* Sometimes, `is_red` is not enough, and you should check whether the pointer
is a `nullptr`, e.g, `ptr && is_red(ptr->left)` instead of `is_red(ptr->left)`,
to avoid null pointer dereferences.

### Testing your own programs

In `04-rbtree` directory, you run the following commands to compile your own
implementation.

```
$ pwd
/xxx/xxx/xxx/04-rbtree
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ ls tests/rbtree_test
./test/rbtree_test
$ ./tests/rbtree_test
[...]
```

If you've all done correctly, the output will look like:

```
===============================================================================
All tests passed (XX assertions in XX test cases)

```

and you are ready to submit!

### Testing deletion

```
$ ./tests/btree_delete_test
[...]
```

If you've all done correctly, the output will look like:


```
===============================================================================
All tests passed (XX assertions in XX test cases)

```

and you are ready to get an extra credit!

### Submission

Prepare your submission with following commands:

```
$ pwd
04-rbtree
$ ./prepare-submit.sh
[*] Remove tar file...
[*] Compress files...
./include/deque.hpp
./palindrome/include/palindrome.hpp
[*] Successfully Compressed!
[*] Done! You are ready to submit
```

Upload `assign4.tar.gz` to the eTL.

### Grading

You will get a _full_ credit, if all tests in `rbtree_test` and `rbtree_delete_test`
pass, *AND* valgrind finds no memory leaks *AND* valgrind reports no memory errors.
